Hello reader,

This repository displays a manually programmed version of the "ls" function from the UNIX file system. myls allows the user to navigate file paths with some options including -i, -l, -R and any combination of the above. 

the command "make" compiles myls.c

Arguments:

./myls -i 
	This will present all files along with their i-nodes.
	
./myls -l 
	This will present all files along with a list of info including
	date created, file permissions, userID, and groupID.
	
./myls -R
	This will run a recursive search through the current file directory as well as any 
	other file directories it finds. It will then display all info specified by the other
	arguments included.
